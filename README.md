Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background
Healthcare is experiencing rapid growth, appearing with intent to ensure it is more accessible, feasible, and for patient experience. Considering the need of the healthcare organizations for digital solutions, hospitals and clinics are implementing systems which improve care, efficiency, and diagnosis. Regarding themes, there are frequently the opportunity to receive timely consultation, the choice of treatment, as well as individual recommendations on medical management. Also, stretched healthcare organizations mean that patients receive care that is delayed, misdiagnosed or in a general disorganization. Digital health systems have thus offered possibilities when it comes to remote consultation, monitoring symptoms and overall patient's health. However, in many systems, this function is not supported with necessary and adequate algorithms that can help the patient learn about his symptoms and the actions to be taken. The gap is filled with the SmartCare Digital Health System which provides reliable diagnosis, treatment recommendations, as well as extreme circumstances such as a hospital visit.
1.2 Problem Statement
The trend in many healthcare systems globally needs efficient and readily available accessible and specialized health advice. Even for patients, challenges arise taking time to explain the symptoms to them, determine when to consult a doctor and where to go for treatment. A current available digital health may have a symptom check or a booking system, however, the framework may not be innovative, or it does not offer a holistic diagnostic one. This gap causes frustration especially in patients who need accurate information concerning their health complication immediately.
1.3 Objectives
1.3.1 General Objective
The project aimed to develop a digital health system that facilitated accurate diagnosis of patient symptoms and offered well-informed recommendations to improve healthcare accessibility and support patient decision-making.
1.3.2 Specific Objectives
The specific objectives of this project were guided by the SMART principle, which emphasizes that any system should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
•	Specific: A single, targeted system was developed and implemented solely for patient symptom assessment and health-related recommendations. The system allowed users to input symptoms and receive appropriate health suggestions. This focus ensured the solution was not generic but directly addressed patient symptoms and personalized health advice.
•	Measurable: The system’s effectiveness was assessed through metrics such as computed disease prevalence accuracy, system response time, and user satisfaction scores. These measures enabled evaluation of the system’s impact on patient outcomes and its overall efficiency.
•	Achievable: The project goals were carefully aligned with available resources to avoid overambitious targets. Despite limited funding, a functional diagnostic and recommendation system with an intuitive user interface was successfully built, demonstrating practical and realistic application of the intended features.
•	Relevant: The system directly addressed the health information needs of users by delivering timely and accurate symptom-based recommendations. It remained true to its core purpose—supporting patients by offering valuable health insights precisely when needed.
•	Time-bound: The project was successfully completed within a three-month period, adhering to set timelines with continuous milestone tracking to ensure consistent progress and timely delivery.
1.4 Purpose
The purpose of the SmartCare Digital Health System is to improve healthcare accessibility by providing an easy-to-use platform for patients to diagnose symptoms and receive recommendations for further care. It aims to deliver initial health insights, guide patients on when to seek treatment, and connect those with severe conditions to the best hospitals in Kenya. This project's goal is to empower patients by enabling informed health decisions, especially for those with limited access to immediate medical assistance.
1.5 Scope
The scope of the SmartCare Digital Health System covers the following key functionalities:
•	Symptom Diagnosis: Enables users to insert symptoms, and from the input generated, the system creates possible health information.
•	Recommendation of Treatment: In simple conditions, treatment options containing advice to administer first aid at home or over-the-counter medicine or medication is recommended for one's case, while in serious conditions, professional healthcare help is advised.
•	Hospital Recommendations: In case of symptoms labelled as severe or critical, the system provides links to accredited hospitals in Kenya which specialize in certain diseases.
•	User Profile Management: The patient site, in particular, might help patients to keep records of their health, and share it across time to get a better understanding of their illness.
•	User-Friendly Interface: This means that the six attributes of the system will enable patients of any age or those who may not have a credible technological background to engage with the system.
The proposed system will in no way become a substitute for professional consultation from medical professionals but is designed to generally help patients make the right choices regarding their health.
1.6 Justification
Timely and easily available healthcare is essential, particularly for those who do not have instant access to physicians or specialized medical facilities. By giving patients personalized advice based on the severity of their symptoms and preliminary insights, SmartCare closes a gap in the present healthcare system. While offering crucial advice for patients with severe symptoms, this might lessen the number of unnecessary clinic appointments for minor problems, relieving the strain on medical professionals. Additionally, the approach facilitates better outcomes for those in need of urgent and targeted care by matching patients with specialized institutions in Kenya. This project offers a complete and dependable tool that improves patient empowerment and healthcare accessibility, which is a significant value proposition given the growing demand for digital health solutions.
1.7 Limitations
While the SmartCare Digital Health System offers valuable preliminary insights, there are some limitations:
Diagnostic Accuracy: Even though the system gives a user an initial assessment of their medical condition based on symptoms, it is much less accurate than a trained healthcare worker. Thus, the information provided by the system is intended only for the purpose of guidance and can in no way replace a consultation with a doctor.
Limited Access to Personalized Treatment Plans: As it was established, conventional symptom-based diagnosis may be vague and therefore the recommendations may not be as detailed as those of a physician that one would consult face to face. This is particularly a disadvantage in the case of multiple or multiple overlapping symptoms.
Dependency on Internet Access: Due to the fact that this is a digital platform, users require efficient internet connection in order to make an efficient use of what this platform offers and may not be very friendly to people in areas with little or no internet connectivity at all.
Restricted Scope to Kenya for Hospital Recommendations: The recommendation of hospitals in the system is restricted to those within the country, Kenya. Some of the users using this app from other countries may not be recommended appropriate treatment for such conditions.
Data Privacy Concerns: Like in any other situation that involves application of technologies within the health attendance sphere, issues of safety and security of the data being used were looked at with a lot of importance. It may be important to constantly recheck as well as ensure that all data entered from users is properly stored and in compliance with all health data protection statutes.


Chapter 2: Literature Review
2.1 Introduction
Over the last few years, systems in digital health have gained more recognition as solutions to problems including restricted access to health care, patient care, and symptom detection. These systems have the intended purpose of bringing convenience and simplicity in observing the state of patient's health, getting preliminary recommendations regarding their treatment, and storing data. However, some of these limitations remain: firstly, in the identification of severe pathology, and secondly, in the issuance of adequate advice on additional targeted treatment. Scientific research has reported on multiple approaches and technologies in the field of digital health and what has been accomplished and what still requires enhancement. This literature review aims at identifying past literature relevant to symptom-based diagnosis systems; and more importantly, which approaches offers accurate personalized recommendations.
2.2 Key Articles and Findings
S/N	Title	Authors	Gap	Solution
1	Digital Health System for Remote Symptom Diagnosis and Patient Guidance	Anderson, J. & Lewis, M.	Lacks integration with local hospitals for severe cases	Integrate hospital recommendation feature for critical symptoms
2	An AI-Driven Framework for Symptom-Based Diagnosis	Kumar, R., & Joshi, A.	Limited accuracy in diagnostic results for complex symptoms	Develop a refined algorithm for symptom assessment
3	Patient Empowerment through Digital Health Systems	Wang, X., & Niazi, F.	Focuses mainly on patient self-management, lacks guidance for severe symptoms	Add alert mechanism for symptoms that need medical attention
4	Mobile Health Applications: Potential and Challenges	Garcia, L., & Smith, E.	Limited to self-care guidance, no connection to hospitals for critical cases	Implement a referral system to connect users to nearby hospitals
5	Enhancing Healthcare Access: Symptom Tracking and Preliminary Diagnosis in Resource-Limited Areas	Chike, O., & Patel, S.	Difficulty in real-time response and tailored recommendations	Introduce machine learning for adaptive response and recommendations
2.3 Selected Gap and Solution
Based on these findings, a key gap identified in most digital health systems is the lack of specialized recommendations for severe cases, where users may need immediate and professional healthcare. While most systems are designed to provide self-care advice or general symptom assessment, few effectively address scenarios that require urgent medical intervention.
Solution: The SmartCare Digital Health System will incorporate a recommendation feature that directs patients with severe symptoms to high-quality hospitals within Kenya. This solution will bridge the identified gap by enabling the system to guide patients with critical conditions to appropriate healthcare facilities, based on the diagnosed symptoms.
2.4 Critique
While each study provides valuable insights into the development and efficacy of digital health systems, they largely focus on general symptom assessment and patient self-management, overlooking the need for more critical diagnostic capabilities. Many systems assume that users will seek medical attention when necessary, but they lack a mechanism to direct patients to specialized care facilities when urgent symptoms are identified. Moreover, although some articles propose AI-driven frameworks, there is limited evidence of their integration with location-specific healthcare resources. By addressing this gap, SmartCare aims to create a more comprehensive digital health system that can not only assist with everyday health monitoring but also offer a structured, actionable response for critical health needs.

Figure 6: Symptom Diagnosis Algorithm Flowchart
The algorithm follows these steps:
1.	Collect symptom data from the user input.
2.	Match reported symptoms against a database of potential conditions.
3.	Calculate a confidence score for each potential diagnosis based on symptom matching.
4.	Rank diagnoses by confidence score.
5.	Determine the severity level of the highest-ranking diagnoses.
6.	Generate appropriate recommendations based on severity levels.
7.	Provide hospital recommendations for severe conditions.
4.3 Implementation Approaches
4.3.1 Development Environment
The development environment was set up to support collaborative development and version control:
•	Local Development: XAMPP was used as the local development server, providing Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
•	Version Control: Git was employed for version control, with GitHub serving as the repository host.
•	Collaborative Tools: Visual Studio Code with Live Share for collaborative coding sessions.
•	API Testing: Using log file to view and test if the API are functioning and running as supposed.
4.3.2 Implementation Standards
The following standards were adhered to during the implementation:
•	Coding Standards: PSR-12 for PHP code style, Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript.
•	Documentation: PHPDoc format for PHP documentation, JSDoc for JavaScript documentation.
•	Security: OWASP guidelines for preventing common web vulnerabilities.
•	API Design: REST architectural principles for API design.
4.3.3 Implementation Process
The implementation followed an iterative approach in line with Agile principles:
1.	Sprint Planning: Each sprint started with planning and setting deliverable goals.
2.	Development: Features were implemented according to the sprint plan.
3.	Testing: Unit and integration tests were performed on completed features.
4.	Review: Code reviews were conducted to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
5.	Deployment: Validated features were deployed to the staging environment.
6.	Feedback: User feedback was collected on deployed features.
7.	Refinement: Features were refined based on feedback before final release.
4.4 Coding Details and Code Efficiency
The HealthGuard system was developed with a focus on clarity, reusability, and performance. Key programming components such as functions, control structures, data structures, and form validation were used to achieve efficient and maintainable code.
4.4.1 Functions: 
The main application logic is modularized using reusable PHP and JavaScript functions. For instance, the diagnoseSymptoms() function receives user inputs, processes them through the symptom database, and returns likely diagnoses along with confidence scores. This encapsulation of logic promotes code reusability and cleaner structure. 
  (Refer to Figure 10: Symptom Diagnosis Function Code)

4.4.2 Control Structures: 
Control flow is primarily managed using conditional statements (if, else if, and switch) and loops (for, foreach). These structures are used for checking user inputs, matching symptoms, and generating personalized output. For example, a foreach loop iterates through the list of symptoms to match them against known medical conditions, while if conditions check for severity levels.
As shown below in code image 
  (See Figure 11: Control Structures Used in Diagnosis Logic)
4.4.3 Data Structures:
 Arrays and associative arrays are employed to store symptoms, diagnoses, and recommendations. For example, a multi-dimensional array holds symptom details along with severity scores to enhance diagnosis precision. This approach allows for efficient lookups and manipulation of large sets of medical data.
  (Refer to Figure 12: Symptom Array Storage)
From above code image an array-like structure is implemented using a Python list called medications_list. This list is initialized as empty and is then populated by iterating through the relevant medications data using a loop. For each matching medication record, a dictionary containing key details such as the name, dosage, instructions, frequency, and side effects is created and appended to the list. As a result, medications_list becomes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a specific medication with its associated information.
4.4.4 API Integration
The SmartCare Digital Health System integrates several APIs to enhance its functionality and provide comprehensive healthcare information to users. These integrations are crucial for accessing medical databases, geolocation services, and hospital information.
 
4.5 Testing Approach
Testing Approach
The testing phase of the HealthGuard Digital Health System was carried out using both functional and user-acceptance testing, aligned with the design model outlined in the system architecture. The state machine-based model was adopted, allowing us to track the system’s response to various input states from symptom input to final health recommendations. Testing was divided into several categories, beginning with unit testing of core functionalities such as symptom input handling, rule-based matching, and diagnosis generation.
To simulate real-world scenarios, JSON files containing predefined symptom sets (e.g., "fever", "cough", "fatigue") were used as input to verify that the system could correctly identify related illnesses such as the Common Cold or Influenza, and return consistent, medically sound outputs. Correspondingly, the system also recommended the best-matching hospitals (e.g., Aga Khan University Hospital) and suitable medications like Paracetamol and Pseudoephedrine, based on the severity level. (See Figure 14: Sample JSON Test Input and Output Screen)
 
To ensure transparency and facilitate debugging, log files were implemented to monitor backend activities during the assessment process. These logs recorded events such as symptom input capture, diagnosis matching, and API responses for hospital recommendations. This method was particularly useful for tracking errors and confirming that each system module functioned as expected during test cases. (Refer to Figure 15: Diagnosis Log Output Sample)
 
4.6 Modifications and Improvements
Following the comprehensive testing phase of the HealthGuard Digital Health System, several bugs and performance issues were identified that necessitated immediate refinement. One of the most critical improvements was optimizing the symptom diagnosis algorithm. Initially, the system struggled to distinguish between closely related conditions like Common Cold and Influenza, often returning overlapping results. To resolve this, the scoring logic within the rule-based engine was modified to apply weighted symptom prioritization, significantly improving the accuracy of the top-ranked diagnosis. (See Figure 16: Updated Symptom Matching Logic)
 
Additionally, the user input interface underwent a usability improvement. Some users found it unclear how to describe their symptoms effectively. To address this, placeholder suggestions were added to the input field (e.g., “e.g., headache, sore throat”), and a tooltip helper was introduced to guide users in formulating accurate inputs. This enhanced clarity and reduced invalid submissions. (Refer to Figure 17: Enhanced Input Field UI)
 
A major backend enhancement involved reworking the log file management system. Logs were initially cluttered with unnecessary metadata, making it difficult to trace specific user sessions. The logging structure was refactored to group logs by session ID and timestamp, which made debugging and monitoring significantly easier. Moreover, a filter mechanism was introduced in the admin panel to quickly search logs by symptom or diagnosis keyword.


Chapter 5: Results and Discussion
5.1 Test Reports
The SmartCare HealthGuard System was rigorously tested to ensure it performs accurately and reliably under various conditions. Functional and edge-case testing was carried out using structured JSON test files that simulated diverse patient inputs. One test case involved the symptom input: "dizziness, sore throat, and fatigue", which triggered the algorithm to correctly diagnose a Common Cold with a confidence level of 45.56% and low severity, as seen in (Figure 18: Diagnosis Result Screen). This demonstrated the algorithm’s ability to map multi-symptom inputs to corresponding diagnoses accurately.
Stress testing was conducted by rapidly submitting multiple symptom queries in succession. The system maintained a consistent response time below 2 seconds per request, confirming its robustness. Additionally, the log file output was reviewed to trace backend performance, which showed clean execution flow with no critical errors—highlighting the system’s error-handling capabilities in live conditions.
Another test case included unusual input (e.g., "sore fingers after gardening"), which triggered a “No Match Found” message with a suggestion to consult a physician directly. This verified the system's ability to handle out-of-scope data gracefully. For every test, related hospital recommendations and medications were displayed appropriately, confirming backend integration of hospital and pharmacy modules.

Upon login, users are greeted by a clean dashboard displaying options like Start New Diagnosis, View History, Schedule Appointment, and Medication Tracker.
Start New Diagnosis: Allows users to enter symptoms in natural language. After specifying symptom duration, the user clicks Start Assessment, which triggers analysis and produces diagnosis results with severity levels. (Figure 20: Symptom Input Modal)
Diagnosis Output: The output page presents the diagnosed condition, confidence level, and recommended next steps. Accompanying data includes hospital suggestions, medication information, and a timestamped record. (Figure 21: Diagnosis Output View)
Hospital Recommendation: The system suggests nearby hospitals (e.g., Aga Khan University Hospital or Nairobi Hospital) based on the diagnosis, location, and ratings. Each listing includes contact info and a map link. (Figure 22: Hospital List Interface)
Medication Tracker: Helps users track prescribed medicine and alerts them when to take doses. Medications like Pseudoephedrine and Dextromethorphan are presented with dosage instructions and side effects. (Figure 23: Medication Tracker View)
View History: All past consultations are stored and can be accessed anytime, helping users follow up or reference previous advice.
The platform is responsive across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, and has been tested for accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Together, these features ensure that any user—regardless of technical background—can easily navigate the system, understand the results, and take informed health-related actions.

Chapter 6: Conclusions
6.1 Conclusion
The development of the SmartCare HealthGuard System has successfully demonstrated how digital technologies can be leveraged to enhance access to preliminary healthcare information, especially in environments where medical professionals may not always be immediately accessible. Through its symptom input analysis, diagnostic recommendations, hospital suggestions, and medication guidance, the system provides users with timely, reliable, and informative health support in a user-friendly interface.
The project achieved its core objectives, including designing a scalable three-tier architecture, implementing a rule-based diagnostic algorithm, and ensuring a seamless user experience through intuitive UI components. Functional and user acceptance testing confirmed the system’s reliability, responsiveness, and ability to handle both typical and edge-case scenarios.
However, there remains significant potential for future improvement. Integrating machine learning models could enhance diagnostic accuracy by learning from user data over time. Additionally, expanding the system to support real-time doctor-patient chat, multilingual interfaces, and wearable health device integration would broaden its applicability and user base. Future work could also involve deploying the system on a secure cloud infrastructure to enable national-scale adoption and interoperability with existing health records systems.
